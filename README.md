## History

Archipelago is built upon a strong legacy of brilliant hobbyists. We want to honor that legacy by showing it here. The repositories which Archipelago is built upon, inspired by, or otherwise owes its gratitude to are:

* [bonta0's MultiWorld](https://github.com/Bonta0/ALttPEntranceRandomizer/tree/multiworld_31)
* [AmazingAmpharos' Entrance Randomizer](https://github.com/AmazingAmpharos/ALttPEntranceRandomizer)
* [VT Web Randomizer](https://github.com/sporchia/alttp_vt_randomizer)
* [Dessyreqt's AlttPRandomizer](https://github.com/Dessyreqt/alttprandomizer)
* [Zarby89's](https://github.com/Ijwu/Enemizer/commits?author=Zarby89) and [sosuke3's](https://github.com/Ijwu/Enemizer/commits?author=sosuke3) contributions to Enemizer.

We recognize that there is a strong community of incredibly smart people that have come before us and helped pave the path. Just because one person's name may be in a repository title does not mean that only one person made that project happen. We can't hope to perfectly cover every single contribution that lead up to Archipelago but we hope to honor them fairly.

## Related Repositories
This project makes use of multiple other projects. We wouldn't be here without these other repositories and the contributions of their developers, past and present.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. We have a few asks of any new contributors.

* Ensure that all changes which affect logic are covered by unit tests. 
* Do not introduce any unit test failures/regressions.

Otherwise, we tend to judge code on a case to case basis. It is a generally good idea to stick to PEP-8 guidelines to ensure consistency with existing code. (And to make the linter happy.)

## Code of Conduct
We conduct ourselves openly and inclusively here. Please do not contribute to an environment which makes other people uncomfortable. This means that we expect all contributors or participants here to:

* Be welcoming and inclusive in tone and language.
* Be respectful of others and their abilities.
* Show empathy when speaking with others.
* Be gracious and accept feedback and constructive criticism.

These guidelines apply to all channels of communication within this GitHub repository. Please be respectful in both public channels, such as issues, and private, such as private messaging or emails.

Any incidents of abuse may be reported directly to Ijwu at hmfarran@gmail.com.
